Heavy is the head that wears a crown this is from the undilutted quote by Williams Shakespaeare's "Henry IV" whixh is "Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown". This is only true for a geniuine true leader, not like what we’ve seen in most African countries. Micheal Taiwo who was born without a silver spoon wears a crown even when he knows it is heavy. Heaviness meaning taking up responsibilties of the society by by helping not only the less priviledges but also vibrant and brlliant individuals with high potentials which are limited due to their lack of resources or where they were born. These responsibities requires sacrificies and consistent efforts. 

While such game changers are rare in the society, i strongly believe that the Micheal Taiwo Scholarship can become that platform that not only assists but also breeds new game changers who also offers to help after benefiting from the initiative. This in itself has also become a motivation for me to strive my best in becoming the best through the opportunities i will enjoy from the mentors and the guidance i will be provided from this scholarship. 

Truly you can go fast alone if you are dedicated and have adopted this so far in my life promising myself i was going to graduate with a distinction during my masters in Unilag, but with a mentor you can go further due to that fact that they've created success and they can now also know guide you on how to create the success faster. Great mentors are not easy to comeby but the Micheal Taiwo Schorlarship have proved beyond doubt with the achievement of their awardees.
